This is only used in documents to refer to the project, so technically it can contain any unicode character,
but it is highly recommended to keep all names consistent, i.e. the package name, which has restrictions,
should be the normalized version of the project name. Therefore, we enforce the restrictions of a
valid non-normalized package name here, and then derive the package name from project name via normalization.

A valid name consists only of ASCII alphanumeric characters, period (.), underscore (_) and hyphen (-).
It must start and end with a letter or number.

GitHub repository names can only contain alphanumeric characters,

All other characters are automatically replaced with hyphens.
Also, GitHub retains the capitalization only when displaying the repository name,
otherwise, names are not case-sensitive. That is, "PyPackIT" will be displayed as is,
but any other capitalization of the word in any URL or address will also point to the same repository.

Notes
-----
There seems to be no official GitHub documentation regarding repository naming rules.
An answer on StackOverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59081778/rules-for-special-characters-in-github-repository-name#comment135091370_59082561)
also seems to be incorrect. The above stated rules were determined experimentally on July 2023.
